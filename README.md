This repository is for building compiler for [PL0](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PL/0) and VM for PM/0. 

[0_VM](https://github.com/1kohei1/COP3402/tree/master/0_VM) is to read PM/0 code, prints the assembler version of pm0 code, and executes the pm0 code displaying the machine state after each instruction.
[1_lex](https://github.com/1kohei1/COP3402/tree/master/1_lex) is to read subset of PL/0 code and prints a token list.
[2_compiler](https://github.com/1kohei1/COP3402/tree/master/2_compiler) is to read PL/0 and output PM/0.
[3_compiler_full](https://github.com/1kohei1/COP3402/tree/master/3_compiler_full) is to extend 2_compiler to handle more PL/0 syntax.
